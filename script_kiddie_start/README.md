## 9. Cyber Hygiene Practices

Cyber hygiene refers to the routine practices and measures individuals and organizations can adopt to protect their digital environments. By maintaining good cyber hygiene, you can reduce the risk of breaches and ensure the integrity of your systems and data.  

### Topics to Learn:  

1. **Understanding Cyber Hygiene:**  
   - The importance of proactive measures in preventing cyberattacks.  
   - Recognizing common threats, such as malware, phishing, and ransomware.  
   - Building habits that prioritize security in daily digital interactions.  

2. **Password Management:**  
   - Creating strong, unique passwords for each account.  
   - Using passphrases or a combination of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  
   - Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.  
   - Using password managers to securely store and manage passwords.  

3. **Software Updates and Patching:**  
   - Keeping operating systems, applications, and firmware up-to-date.  
   - Understanding the importance of security patches in fixing vulnerabilities.  
   - Automating updates where possible to ensure timely patching.  

4. **Secure Browsing Practices:**  
   - Using HTTPS and avoiding unsecured websites.  
   - Recognizing and avoiding phishing websites and pop-ups.  
   - Disabling unnecessary browser extensions and plugins.  
   - Clearing cookies and browsing data regularly.  

5. **Safe Email Practices:**  
   - Identifying phishing attempts and suspicious attachments.  
   - Avoiding clicking on unknown links or downloading unverified files.  
   - Using spam filters and email security tools to reduce risks.  
   - Verifying sender identities, especially for sensitive requests.  

6. **Network Security:**  
   - Securing home and workplace Wi-Fi with strong passwords and encryption.  
   - Using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) on public Wi-Fi to protect data.  
   - Regularly updating router firmware and disabling WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup).  
   - Segmenting networks for different devices (e.g., IoT vs. work devices).  

7. **Data Backup Practices:**  
   - Regularly backing up important files to external drives or cloud storage.  
   - Testing backup restoration processes to ensure data integrity.  
   - Encrypting backups to protect sensitive information.
